## MySql Lite Administrator ##
is a php web application that will help you insert and update stuff in your MySQL Database.


**News 25/02/2010:**
  * MySql Lite Administrator (beta1) is out
  * Now MySQL Administrator uses  brilliant  [TinyTable 3](http://www.leigeber.com/2009/11/advanced-javascript-table-sorter/)
  * [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/) is removed  for making unnecessary conflicts ( the application is public protected so there is no real need for additional security, at least I hope so :-) )
  * Some bugs  fixed

Almost all the modern web sites use databases. MySql is probably the most used database for web application. There are many web tools that interact with MySQL, PHPMyAdmin is a great example. But the problem is they are very complex for non expert user. That is why I decided to create user friendly web application for basic management of MySQL.

**MySQL Lite Administrator is right for you if:**

  * You have small database and not complex database logic.
  * You have primary key on your database tables.
  * You need to insert and update data.

**How to use this application?**

It is meant to be plug and play application - just copy files on your server were is your MySQL database placed.

Go to index.php and login with your database username and password.
